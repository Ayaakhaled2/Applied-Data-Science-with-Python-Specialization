# The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language.

- This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.

- Introduction to Data Science in Python (course 1), 
- Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (course 2),
-  and Applied Machine Learning in Python (course 3) should be taken in order and prior to any other course in the specialization
